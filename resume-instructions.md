# Resume Tailoring Instructions

**Master Source**  
All tailoring work must be based on the most recent version of the résumé at:  
[https://homebase99.github.io/stronghold/resume-build1](https://homebase99.github.io/stronghold/resume-build1)  
This is the single source of truth for all roles, skills, tools, and achievements.

## Core Rules
- **No Fabrication**  
  Only reframe, re‑sequence, or condense existing, verifiable content from the master résumé.
- **ATS Alignment**  
  - Extract keywords, tools, and role‑specific phrases directly from the job posting.  
  - Integrate them naturally into relevant bullets without keyword stuffing.
- **Relevance First**  
  - Prioritize bullets, metrics, and tools that directly match the posting’s requirements.  
  - Downplay or omit unrelated experience unless it demonstrates transferable skills.
- **Length & Structure**  
  - Keep tailored résumé to **2 pages max**.  
  - Maintain consistent section headings, spacing, and formatting.
- **Tone Matching**  
  - Mirror the tone of the job posting (formal, technical, creative, etc.) in both résumé and cover letter.

## Tailoring Workflow
1. **Input from User**  
   - Link to the job posting **or** paste the job description.  
   - Any special notes (e.g., “emphasize API docs” or “downplay healthcare”).
2. **Analysis**  
   - Identify the posting’s core deliverables, must‑have skills, nice‑to‑have skills, and cultural cues.  
   - Map these to the most relevant bullets, tools, and metrics from the master résumé.
3. **Execution**  
   - Re‑order and trim bullets to surface the most relevant content first.  
   - Adjust phrasing to match the job’s language and ATS keywords.
4. **Output**  
   - Tailored résumé text (ready to paste into the master file or export).  
   - Matching cover letter draft.

## Cover Letter Guidelines
- **Length**: 3 short paragraphs.
- **Structure**:  
  1. **Hook** — Show alignment with the role/company and reference a specific detail from the posting.  
  2. **Proof** — Highlight 2–3 achievements/tools from the master résumé that directly solve their needs.  
  3. **Close** — Confident call to action.
- Avoid generic statements; make it feel written for *this* role only.
