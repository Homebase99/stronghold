## DAY-TO-DAY TASKS

Creating and managing technical documentation for a client-facing product can be very cyclical. 

There is always something new to add and there is always something to change with every new sprint. 

Over time, documentation becomes a constant loop of research, writing, editing, and publication – with an ever-growing list of tasks for the next product release. 

My day-to-day tasks included:

- Creating customer-facing technical documents such as:
- User manuals and instructional guides for products using Adobe RoboHelp, Madcap Flare, and MS Word
  + Online help files and technical support documents using Atlassian Confluence, WordPress, and Ghost
  + Version update notes and archived release notes using Adobe FrameMaker, MS Word, and Adobe Acrobat
  +	Short, simplified, and targeted guides using MS Word
- Updating the following based on changes made during the sprint:
  +	Existing technical guides and procedures to match the product’s latest updates and changes
  +	Existing screenshots and field/button definitions to match the product’s latest user interface changes
- Proofreading and editing existing technical documents to match design and formatting styles based on the company’s established guidelines.    
- Accessing the pre-release version of the application to directly view, research, play around, and document the changes.
- Researching and simplifying technical terms to make instructions clear, detailed, and accessible for the target audience.
- Adjusting the complexity in the technical instructions to match the target audience’s comprehension and familiarity level.
- Creating tutorial support clips and additional e-learning content using Adobe Captivate.
- Creating and managing supplemental visuals, art, and instructional graphics using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

## COLLABORATIVE TASKS

From experience, technical writing is 50% documentation and 50% collaboration. 

Without constant communication and feedback from the Development Team, the current documentation is at risk of being out of date, inaccurate, or incomplete. And the last thing you need to hear after publication is a team member wanting last-minute changes to the already-published work. 

Therefore, it is necessary to keep the team informed during the entire technical writing process.

During the course of a standard sprint cycle, my team-centric tasks include:

- Monitoring the product’s developments and roadblocks via user stories and attached files in Atlassian Jira and other online support files. This ensures accurate and up-to-date sources for documentation.
- Collaborating with Designers, QAs, Developers, and Product Owners to gather information on documentation changes.
- Providing drafts for review to associated team members using Adobe Acrobat, OneDrive, and SharePoint.
- Gathering feedback with each user story’s assigned development team members on technical documentation drafts to:
  + Ensure clarity and accuracy of final documentation
  +	Incorporate their insights to enhance team rapport and line of communication for future sprints and projects
- Acting as a liaison between Development Team members to resolve conflicts in feedback. This is to ensure that the changes have been approved by both the QAs and the Developers. 
- Attending meetings, presentations, and demos using MS Teams to discuss changes and progress in the user stories.

## WHY HIRE ME?

My main sales pitch highlights my specialization and years of experience in two areas: technical writing and graphic design.

Technical writing is essential to effectively teach readers about a given topic. A good technical writer can provide clear, well-researched, and concise guides that can help both new and experienced users with their current problems.  

Adding graphic design to the mix further enhances the learning material by offering visual aid, quick summaries, and infographics. Key visuals can help reinforce the necessary concepts, making them easier to understand and remember. This combination ensures a comprehensive and engaging learning experience for all types of learners, enhancing retention of the subject matter.

## A HISTORY OF REMOTE WORK

Over the years, I have collaborated remotely with global teams, companies, and individual clients. Here, I contributed to technical documentation, support documentation, digital content, and graphic assets tailored for international audiences.

A decade of remote work has honed my skills in time management and workload prioritization. I have learned to prioritize user stories and tasks at the start of every sprint to allocate enough time for research and writing on major projects, while also ensuring that smaller changes still receive thorough documentation. 

It has also strengthened my ability to work independently without constant supervision, while also still understanding the importance of continuous collaboration to ensure accurate and up-to-date documentation.

## ADDITIONAL INFO

**For RIA Advisory's Senior Consultant role:**

They had existing lessons for these applications. In-house for their bootcampers/new employees. But the recordings were messy; the speaker couldn't speak fluent English and was audibly nervous. There were also tons of pauses due to the classroom setting.

So I manually transcribed what the instructor was saying (the sharepoint auto-transcription was nearly useless), then fixed the grammar, ensured the lectures were correct, then rearranged the topics to have a better flow. The script I made for these topics would then be fed to an AI voice thing which would be the instructor for the next batch of bootcampers.

**For RIA Advisory and Optum's stints:**

For Oracle applications: Revenue Management and Billing (RMB), Customer Cloud Service application or CCS, and Customer to Meter or C2M. CCS and C2M are essentially the same, with CCS being cloud-based and C2M being local.

For Optum's healthcare apps, I was in charge of documentation for the Central Services division of their applications. This includes Converge Rx (CRX, my main application), Storage Based Mail Order (SBMO), PDX-MS, Clinical Interview (which I created its help files from scratch), POM API (Patient Opportunity Management), this one had the API documentation that I technically did, but my head writer did most of the heavy lifting. EOPN (EPS Outgoing Patient Notification Record), ePharmacy.

I also did other stuff for Optum (I included here the tech writing stuff as well):

- Created new help file entries and updated existing ones for each application with Adobe RoboHelp
- Published release notes for version updates at the end of every sprint with Adobe FrameMaker and MS Word
- Created documentation and tutorial clips with Adobe Captivate: 
  + Step-by-step guides on how to use basic application features
  + In-app demos on how to complete common tasks
- Collaborated with the design, QA, and development team members to create accurate and up-to-date documentation that covers each application’s most recent changes 
- Graphic design and image creation with Photoshop and Illustrator: 
  + Created visuals for reports and PowerPoint presentations 
  + Edited and updated logos, images, and favicons

## TECHNICAL WRITER + GRAPHIC DESIGNER

The need to understand is universal. 

When face-to-face learning is not available, the help manual becomes the next best resource. Because of this, it is crucial to keep a product's technical documentation comprehensive, up to date, and visually engaging.

I have profound respect and appreciation for technical documents, and I genuinely enjoy the process of creating and maintaining them. 

My day-to-day tasks include:

### WORK HISTORY

Since 2012, I have had the privilege of working with international clients. During this time, I have performed duties as a technical writer, content writer, graphic designer, or a combination of these roles – tailored to the needs of each company and their target audience.

This diversity in topics and target audiences has ingrained in me the habit of writing from the reader's perspective. I ensure that the content is easy enough for new users to understand, detailed enough to satisfy experienced users, and concise enough for those seeking a quick solution to their problems.

Here I relist the work history, no need to repeat.

### SKILLS AND INTERESTS

- Believe it or not, I have been creating technical documentation (in some capacity) since I was in high school. 
Growing up in a poor environment, I had to quickly learn the basics of PC repair to avoid expenses. I taught myself how to troubleshoot computer issues and to apply a fix when possible. This involved:
	+ Identifying issues and diagnosing the problem
	+ Doing the research to find a solution
	+ Translating technical jargon into something more accessible
	+ Applying what I learned and seeing if it resolved the issue
	+ Documenting the steps taken for future reference
- I watch an incredibly unhealthy amount of The Office, Brooklyn 99, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. 
- I have a love-hate relationship with World of Warcraft.
- In addition to 10+ years of graphic design, I also enjoy drawing digitally on Adobe Photoshop with my drawing tablet.

## TECHNICAL WRITER
2021 – 2024 | Change Healthcare/Optum (USA) 

For the past three years, I worked exclusively as a technical writer for the US-based company Change Healthcare/Optum. Here, I was responsible for managing the technical documentation for their hospital and pharmacy-based applications.

I worked exclusively on the graveyard shift to effectively collaborate with my US-based colleagues across the writing, design, QA, and development teams. With the use of Remote Desktop, I performed all my tasks on a permanent remote setup.

### RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Used Adobe RoboHelp to create new help file entries and update existing content, ensuring changes were reviewed, completed, and published at the end of each sprint cycle.

- Used Adobe FrameMaker and MS Word to publish release notes for version updates at the end of every sprint.

- Used Adobe Captivate to create tutorial clips of common tasks in an application, which were then embedded directly into the help files to enhance the learning process.

- Used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for graphic design and image creation, including infographics and images embedded within help files, release notes, MS PowerPoint presentation slides, and other visual aids.

- Used MS Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Jira to efficiently collaborate with the writing, design, QA, and development team members throughout the entire Agile development process, ensuring accurate and up-to-date documentation during each release.

- Used MS Excel to track the progress of the current sprint’s Jira user stories, their documentation needs, and completion status.

- Researched and simplified technical terms and procedures to make instructions clear and accessible for the application's target audience.

- Edited and reviewed existing content to match the current sprint's updates. 

- Ensured accuracy in grammar, sentence structure, and overall content consistency while following the company's format and style guidelines.

### PREVIOUS WORK SUMMARY

Apart from technical writing, I also delved into:

- **Search Engine Optimization** (SEO) is about refining the target web content with relevant keywords to improve the site’s visibility on search engines. More visibility means a higher likelihood of someone visiting the website when they use the search engine to look for related information.

- **Content Writing** involves the creation of engaging and relevant material in WordPress to drive traffic to the website.

- **Graphic Design** is the creation of visual website content through Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. This helps enhance the user experience by providing visual aids, attractive thumbnails, and key visuals.

- **Content Management** combines all these factors and turns a website into a well-oiled machine. If successful, a website can see an increase in organic traffic with an increase in audience engagement and retention.

### WORK HISTORY
- Same as current so I'm not adding here

### EDUCATION
- Saint Louis University
- Bachelor of Science in Nursing
- Graduated April 2012
- Took and passed the nursing board exam July 2012	
								
### SKILLS AND INTERESTS
- Believe it or not, I have been doing technical writing (in some capacity) since I was in high school. 

  + Growing up in a poor environment, I had to quickly learn the ins and outs of PC repair. 
  + Specifically, I taught myself how to troubleshoot hardware and software issues and to apply a fix when possible.
  + This involved pinpointing the problem, doing the research, translating technical jargon into something I could understand, applying the solution, and writing a detailed step-by-step guide for future reference – just in case the issue reappeared.

- I watch an incredibly unhealthy amount of The Office, Brooklyn 99, Community, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. 

- I firmly believe that the best way to learn is through hands-on experience. I taught myself how to use all the applications mentioned in this resume by hands-on practice – learning by doing. When you enjoy something, mastering it comes naturally.

- I have a love-hate relationship with World of Warcraft.

- In addition to 10+ years of graphic design, I enjoy drawing digitally on Adobe Photoshop with my drawing tablet. And yes, I learned by doing – starting with MS Paint and a mouse.
